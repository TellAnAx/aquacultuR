# Contributing to the aquacultuR package

Thank you for your interest in helping improve the aquacultuR package! 
This package is an Open Source project and open for contributions from 
the outside world!
Whether you want to fix a bug, or suggest
new features, this guide will help you get started. ðŸŽ‰



## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Start coding!



## Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch for any changes you want to make!**
   - Use descriptive names like `growth-metric-feature` or `fix-documentation-typo`
2. Make your changes and test them locally with sample student data.
3. Push your branch and create a pull request
4. Assign a reviewer to your pull request.
5. Wait for review and address any feedback.



## Code Style

- We follow the 'Advanced R' Style Guide by Hadley Wickham: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
- Use clear, descriptive variable names (student_name, start_time, etc.)
- Use the reformatting functions implemented in RStudio to format the code.
- Where necessary, add comments to describe blocks of logic.



## Need help or have ideas?

- Check the open issues first.
  - If your problem is there, add a comment or up-vote.
  - If not there, create a new issue. Be as descriptive as possible.
  - Add labels to your opened issue, e.g. `enhancement` for new functions.
